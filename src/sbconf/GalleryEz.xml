Display a slideshow based on a Gallery web site (easy version).

This is the "easy" version of the Gallery Slideshow; the only parameter you need to configure
is the Configuration URL, which the person who asked you to download and install this screen saver
must have provided. If that's not the case, or you want to use a version where you can
pick the albums that should be displayed in the slideshow, you should use the non-EZ version of
the Gallery screensaver.
