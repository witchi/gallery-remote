	  around the text).
	* Fixed a regression in setting the user-agent for
	  the applets (broken since 1.5.1-b7)
	* Another attempt at finding the proxy automatically for
	  applets (it works in Java 1.4, but not in 1.5 and 1.6;
	  Sun really messed up on that stuff!)
	* Changed the slideshow prefs UI to use sliders for times
	  and introduced a preference for the transition duration.

2006-11-14  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.5.1-b26)

	* Fixed multi-line caption alignment.
	* Now capturing out of memory errors and displaying message

	  environment varible can be set to a comma-delimited list
	  of modules; only those modules will appear in the log.

2006-07-20  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.5.1-b18)

	* Added smooth transition effects in slideshow. For this to
	  be enabled, the slideshowTransitionDuration property needs
	  to be set to a number of milliseconds for the transition.
	  Also, it works much better on Java 1.6 beta, because the new
	  version enables OpenGL for Java 2D operations.

2006-06-07  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.5.1-b17)

	  to G2.
	* Fixed DHTML during and after upload with mini applet in G2.

2006-02-26  Alan Harder (1.5.1-b13)

	  New gr_locale applet parameter for specifying locale
	  Include resource bundles in the AppletMini jar
	  Add GRI18n.getString for two untranslatable strings
	* Implemented showAppletResize property (it is supposed to hide
	  this checkbox when false, but there was no code to do this)

2005-12-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.5.1-b7)

	* Explicitly disabling keep-alive for the GR protocol
	  which could help alleviate sometimes-reported problem
	  of hanging connections (thanks Valiant).

	* Fixed another bug with URL loading introduced in b2.
	* Added IM path detection fallback for Windows systems that
	  don't have reg.exe (all but XP Pro and Server 2003).
	* Added 4 and 5Mpix sizes
	* Added JPEG resize quality parameter to a Gallery profile.
	  This can't be changed in the preferences, but can be changed
	  in the GalleryRemote.properties preferences file by adding
	  resizeJpegQuality.n=q, where n is the profile number and q
	  is the quality, between 0 and 99.

2005-12-05  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.5.1-b3)

	* Fixed bug introduced in b2 when loading settings.

2005-12-02  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.5.1-b2)

	* Added settings to change the font and font size in slideshow.
	  There is no user-interface to set these, you have to change them
	  in the GalleryRemote.properties or GalleryRemoteApplet.properties
	  files.
	* Downloading the list of albums is slightly more robust.
	* The thumbs temporary directory is now postfixed with the
	  current username, so on multiuser systems different users
	  will be able to use GR concurrently. Thanks mattdm.
	* Reworked the way defaults and prefs are loaded to they can be more
	  flexibly overriden by the server, in the case of the applet.

2005-09-23  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.5.1-b1)

	* Fixed getting album list and creating albums when the names
	  of albums contain non-ASCII characters (using UTF-8).

	* Release.
	* Installer built using IA 7.1, which supports Java 5.

2005-09-20  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4.2-b27)

	* With G2, the slideshow now increments the view count on images.

2005-08-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4.2-b26)

	* Slideshows starting on a specific picture (G2 only) now start
	  on the right picture, not the next one...
	* The preload thread for pictures in a slideshow is now running
	  at a lowered priority, which reduces makes the slideshow more
	  reponsive.
	* G2 now has a recursive and limitable slideshow.

2005-08-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4.2-b25)

	* GR now uploads images and creates albums with UTF-8 when
	  connected to G2. This fixes improper behavior when using non-ASCII
	  characters. This only happens if HTML escaping is disabled.

2005-08-06  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4.2-b24)

	* GR can now find ImageMagick on its own on Windows, by looking in
	  the registry. Using a newer version of IM can speed up image
	  operations by a factor of 2! It is now recommended to
	  install IM independantly of GR to get this benefit.
	  This is all the more important for the applet.

2005-07-30  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4.2-b23)

	* Now using the new format for the remote controller URL in G2.

	* Added ability to force the Gallery version to avoid problems with
	  auto-detection of G1 installations when the web server sends back
	  a bogus 404 message. Just add to your GalleryRemote.properties a line
	  with forceGalleryVersion.1=[1|2].

2005-05-19  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4.2-b19)

	* Added ability for the slideshow to loop.
	* Fixed GR barfing on non-integer sleep times for slideshow.
	* Added support for 0 sleep-time: immediate display of next
	  picture. Thanks to Andy Staudacher for the suggestions.

2005-05-19  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4.2-b18)

	* GR now sets user-agent and referer to fetch pictures, to comply
	  with elevated G2 security when using Block hotlinked items in the
	  URL Rewrite module.

2005-05-04  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4.2-b17)

	* GR and the GR applets are now able to run slideshows of G2
	  albums.
	* Slideshows can now start from a picture other than the first.
	  This is only available in the G2 applet right now.
	* Added debugging for thoses cases when some preferences are
	  missing.

2005-05-02  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4.2-b16)

	* Added support for slideshows of G2 albums, a prelude to
	  adding java-based fullscreen slideshows in G2.

2005-04-27  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4.2-b15)

	* Added support for an arbitrary number of cookies to be passed
	  to the applets, with the applet parameters gr_cookie/n/_name
	  and gr_cookie/n/_value where /n/ starts with 1 and are consecutive.

2005-04-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4.2-b14)

	* Added support for the applet to force the version of Gallery
	  it's embedded in, to overcome instances of Apache sending
	  a 200 error code even though gallery_remote2.php doesn't exist
	  instead of 404 (in G2).

2005-04-22  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4.2-b13)

	* Fixed error message for self-signed cert to point to GR documentation.

	* Fixed drop target indication when dropping to the last
	  item in the list and the list is taller than the window.
	* When connecting to an HTTPS server that uses a certificate
	  that is not signed by a trusted root-CA, no longer displaying
	  alert (the URL in the alert was no longer valid, anyway).
	* Decode HTML entities in captions for slideshow.
	* Added a patch by Frode Tviberg that finally fixes Linux DnD.
	* Added Romanian language support from Dragos Neagu.

2005-01-06  Bharat Mediratta  <bharat@menalto.com> (1.4.2-b8)

	* Added support for passing the browser's User-Agent string into the
	  applet as a parameter so that the applet can pretend that it is the

	  problems when albums have to be upgraded, and potentially
	  network errors.

	  the errors so far and keeps going.
	* Transformed all \n to \u000A to fix the problems with
	  MessagePattern stripping linefeeds.

	* Fixed Java resize when thumbnails are present.

2004-07-10  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-RC1)

	* Fixed hidden image bug in slideshow applet.

2004-07-09  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b17)

	* When the session expires, GR now attempts to login again.
	* Fixed duplicate extra field
	* Added a warning when EXIF data is about to be dumped by Java resize
	* Enabled silent install in the ZeroG installer.

2004-06-24  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b16)

	* New Album dialog now prevents user from attempting to create
	  a new album inside an album where the user doesn't have
	  privileges to do so. Bug 925434.

2004-06-21  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b15)

	* Improved DE language file (thanks Joerg Napp).
	* Attempted to fix a bug with urlFull handling in embedded applets.

2004-06-02  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b14)

	* Resize before upload is now a 1-dimension editable ComboBox
	  of popular sizes, like Gallery.
	* Fixed displaying information at the bottom of slideshow.
	* When constraining to aspect ratio while cropping, now
	  able to use portrait and landscape of aspect ratio.
	* Fixed EXIF support to trim spaces.

2004-05-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b13)

	* Added support for non-8bit characters in album and image data.
	  If GR is running in a non-international system and the default
	  font used by Java is not able to display the text correctly,
	  the FONT_OVERRIDE_* properties can force GR to use any system
	  font.
	  This only works if the album and image data are encoded by
	  Gallery in HTML entities (&#xxxx;). When adding albums and
	  images, it only works if automatic HTML escaping is on.
	* Added support for running GR in l10n-development mode by setting
	  uiLocaleDev=true in the prefs. This will load the language files
	  from img/ so they're easy to modify.
	* Fixed a problem in the applet where using the applet and then
	  moving to another tab and coming back would result in the list
	  of pictures being "Problem...".
	* Added credits for translators in Locale prefs.
	* Fixed some bugs when no Gallery profile yet exists.

2004-05-11  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b12)

	* Fixed failure to resize GIFs in Java.

2004-05-11  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b11)

	* Fixed NPE when leaving slideshow applet.

2004-05-11  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b10)

	* Fixed upload (and slideshow) applets when Gallery is embedded in a CMS.
	* Applets now attempt to use the same language as the Gallery (GR language
	  support is sorely lacking at the moment).
	* Cleaned up UI of upload applet, added config parameters for showing
	  Resize before upload and divider location.

2004-05-07  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b9)

	* Fixed a slowdown when moving past many pictures in slideshow.

2004-05-07  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b8)

	* Fixed a runaway thread in slideshow that would lock up
	  the VM.

2004-05-06  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b7)

	* Added support for cropping before upload! This is done in
	  the preview window. For best performance, this needs the
	  patched version of jpegtran that adds a -crop option for
	  lessless cropping.
	* Fixed New Album and Move Album.
	* Added support for pre-downloading all pictures in slideshow.

	This version is ready to replace 1.3.3 as the default branch
	Saving is still disabled, though. Be careful.
	Also on my machine, GR stalls without a message on Linux, both
	on Blackdown and Sun VMs.

2004-04-28  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b6)

	* Added GeekLog support.
	* Fixed updating the album tree after creating an album.
	* Slideshow: better feedback when manually moving to another picture.
	* Slideshow: fixed picture-switching delay being incorrect after manually
	  moving to another picture.
	* New preference to override background color for slideshow and preview.
	* Slideshow: new method for painting information on top of image, text no longer
	  moves.
	* Slideshow: new controller display, similar to iPhoto, with help.

2004-04-21  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b5)

	* Added support for Gallery aliases, to use as a handle instead of the
	  Gallery URL in the GR UI.
	* Implemented slideshow preference to not stretch small images in
	  preview and slideshow.
	* Fixed local slideshow broken in 1.4-b3.
	* Fixed one syntax incompatibility for Java 1.5.

2004-04-20  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b4)

	* Added German translation, by Hubert Baumgartner (extremely incomplete).

2004-04-20  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b3)

	* When ImageMagick is not available, resize before upload
	  uses Java 1.4 ImageIO to resize the image. This might cause
	  OutOfMemoryErrors in some cases; I'm trying to reproduce.
	  It also causes the EXIF information to be lost. I'm trying to find
	  a way to fix this, but the ImageIO classes (java 1.4) are pretty
	  broken.
	* Disabled Save and Open until we know how we're going
	  to handle saving and loading.
	* Merged changes from 1.3 branch.
	* Applets now work even if Gallery is in (unsupported)
	  relative mode (album and gallery URLs are relative)
	* Allowing ImageMagick and Jpegtran settings to be overriden
	  in the general settings (beware, the format of these files has
	  consequently changed).

2004-03-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b2)

	* Integrated Marc Pawliger's patch that reads the default
	  caption from IPTC or EXIF.
	* Disabled saving state (the menus are still there) because
	  state saving crashes.
	* Initial implementation of G2 interoperability. On the GR side,
	  the only change is that it changes some of the URL parameter names
	  to fit the GR theme: g2_form[name]=value. Also, GR senses
	  if a given install is a G1 or a G2 with the remote module and
	  uses the right URL.

2004-02-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.4-b1)

	* Attempt to make the tree render correctly by moving to
	  DefaultTreeModel and DefaultMutableTreeNodes. This is still
	  unsuccessful and I need help.
	* Diabled Protocol 1, since it's incompatible with sophisticated
	  tree handling.
	* Much improved model classes, through a major refactoring.

	Some functionality broken, DO NOT USE THIS VERSION, stay on BRANCH_GR_1_3

2004-04-15  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.2-b11)

	* No longer resizing up (upsampling) images that are smaller than
	  the album maximum size on upload.

2004-04-12  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.2-b10)

	* Parentheses are invalid in album names.
	* GR now honors hidden images and read permissions for albums.

2004-03-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.2-b9)

	* On Java 1.4.2 and later, reading proxy from Java plugin in
	  applet mode.

2004-03-15  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.2-b8)

	* Fixed a bug in the applet uploader, where added pictures were
	  not shown.
	* From this version on, the applets are signed with a certificate
	  authenticated by Thawte.

	This is considered a final candidate for GR 1.3.2.

2004-02-27  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.2-b7)

	* Added support for Basic auth username and password embedded in
	  URL, such as http://user:pass@server/path/. This is obviously
	  an insecure way of storing passwords. Thanks to Mindstorm for
	  letting me test on his server.
	* Fixed a bunch of niggles with the Auth dialog.
	* Added flushing of the JTree when adding a new
	  album. It's better than fetching the albums again from the server
	  but it loses album state. I spent two days trying to debug this
	  but I can't crack this problem of the JTree not refreshing.
	  Help needed!

2004-02-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.2-b6)

	* Solved a very long-standing problem where I didn't know how
	  to get the albums tree to draw correctly when adding images
	  (the album name would be truncated).
	* When adding an album, no longer refreshing the list of albums
	  (this makes it faster and doesn't lose the album tree's
	  disclosure status)
	* When downloading pictures from the server, flush any previously
	  downloaded pictures first.
	* Made fetching list of albums from the server slightly faster
	  by disabling events during the download, so the window is
	  only refreshed when the download completes.
	* Fixed a bug in GRI18n where quote characters in strings that
	  are subjected to pattern-matching to replace some of the text at
	  runtime would cause the pattern-matching algorithm to barf.
	  Also created a cache for patterns.

2004-02-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.2-b5)

	* Updated French translation by Alex Lemaresquier.
	* Added debugging info to trace bug where adding pictures via
	  Browse... doesn't work but DnD'ing them does.

2004-02-23  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.2-b4)

	* Fixed Linux tree display error. Thanks to "herk" for
	  finding the problem. The album tree no longer has a horizontal
	  scrollbar, but uses tooltips. The tooltips only appear if
	  part of the name is obscured, ala Windows Tree Control.

2004-02-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.2-b3)

	* Another try at fixing that Swing error. I now think that this
	  is tied to Swing's attempt to use Windows XP themes. I'm now
	  using a property that should disable this buggy behavior.

2004-02-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.2-b2)

	* Catching a wierd VM bug that causes many users not to be able
	  to upload. This bug is I believe caused by the 1.4.2_03-b2 VM.

2004-02-17  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.2-b1)

	* Albums are now sorted alphabetically when using the latest
	  protocol.
	* Added a new launcher in the IA project for debug, which
	  sets the output to a console.
	* When IA console is set, the Log will automatically be sent
	  to stdout. This is to make it easier to have users send
	  in bug reports that include exceptions.

2004-02-12  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.1)

	* Re-release...

2004-02-12  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.1-b3)

	* Slideshow button is disabled when ther are no pictures to show.
	* This is also the case in the slideshow applet, and an alert is
	  displayed.

2004-02-12  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.1-b2)

	* Fixed slideshow on the Mac (the top of the image was
	  obscured by the menu bar). I can't figure out why the Mac VM
	  will not go into full-screen mode...
	* Fixed a potential VM killer bug with going into slideshow
	  mode. This was a Safari-crashing bug on Mac.

2004-02-12  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3.1-b1)

	* Fixed text color in list and tree when selected.
	* State is clean after an upload attemps (since state
	  was saved to the default location).
	* Fixed bug where loading a state with no pictures in it
	  would make the UI disabled.

	Thanks to Robert Harlow for these.

2004-02-11  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3)

	* Fixed moving album to root of Gallery.
	* Changed log file name to GalleryRemoteLog.txt and updated the
	  docs to reflect the change of name and location.

	Release!

2004-02-10  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b29)

	* Added support for flushing caches. This is useful when uploading
	  from a removable media where the picture names may be the same.
	* Added support for limiting the number of images in a slideshow,
	  similar to the javascript version. Also for disabling recursion.

2004-02-09  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b28)

	* Fixed yet another concurrency problem in slideshow, when using
	  both manual and automatic slide changes.
	* Fixed caption not being outlined. Saldy, this means the caption
	  is not HTML capable and single-line only.

2004-02-04  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b27)

	* GR now requires Java 1.4 or later, too many things are unsupported
	  on 1.3 and all OSes have 1.4 VMs.
	* Disabled some album properties and added a note regarding the
	  fact that these properties are read-only for now.
	* Added random option to slideshow.
	* Changed font sizes on Mac applet so it fits the dimensions.
	  The applet still crashes Safari though. I've submitted a bug
	  report to Apple.
	* Added French (Christophe Lallement) and Catalan (sergidsca)
	  translations.
	* I consider this build to be 1.3-RC1, and I hope to have a final
	  release of 1.3 along with G 1.4.2 final.

2004-01-29  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b26)

	* Added pretty nasty hack to reload the album page in Mini applet
	  mode after upload completes.
	* Applet Maxi working again (I broke it a couple of builds ago).

2004-01-29  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b25)

	* Made Log re-entrant, so that when Applet is restarted within
	  the same VM, the log can keep going.
	* Slideshow applet now pre-fetches the first picture for a faster
	  start.

2004-01-29  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b24)

	* Recursive slideshows.
	* Added protocol support for getting sub-albums as well as pictures
	  when fetching list of pictures in an album.
	* Fixed bugs in upload applet, which was completely broken in b23.

2004-01-27  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b23)

	* All and any property can be overriden by Applet parameters.
	* Slideshow applet now has preferences.

2004-01-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b22)

	* Fixed slideshow causing exception on platforms capable
	  of using full-screen but where some manager decides to forbid
	  it...
	* Add pictures dialog now allows users to select whole folders
	  (thanks Terje).
	* AppletMini no longer downloads the list of albums (faster).

2004-01-23  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b21)

	* More refactoring to improve startup sequence for the applets.
	* Slideshow applet now doesn't doawload the list of albums, which
	  was wrong in the first place because it would only show writable
	  albums.

2004-01-25  M. Scott Gartner <sgartner@pingbot.com> (1.3-b20)

    * Fixed the dates on the January 2004 entries to be 2004.
    * Fixed a NPE in CoreUtils, getListCellRendererComponent() when the
      album list has no currently selected item.
    * Changed to allow user to save state before logout.
    * Restored code in logout to clear the dirty flag (for some reason
      this code was lost in version 1.3-b19).
	* Changed to set dirty flag when a picture's order is changed (picture
      is moved).
    * Changed to set dirty flag when a picture is moved or deleted from
      the PictureInspector panel.

2004-01-22  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b19)

	* Fixed file loading behavior: GR now logs into each Gallery
	  that it was previously logged into, and displays better
	  feedback.
	* Fixed NPEs when logging out and closing dirty but unsaved
	  files.
	* Added slideshow applet
	* More refactoring to support the new applet. The Applet code
	  is now modular and duplication-free.

2004-01-20  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b18)

	* Fixed some threading problems in slideshow.
	* Implemented preference to download the lowrez version
	  of an image in slideshow.
	* i18n of applet.
	* Fixed problems when two applets are running concurrently

2004-01-16  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b17)

	* More refactoring to make the mini applet more modular.
	  Shaved 100KB+ from the total applet weight.

2004-01-15  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b16)

	* MASSIVE refactoring to make GR more modular to prepare
	  for the various applet versions.
	* Changed log location from working directory to temp dir.
	* Added a mini applet that only contains a list of files
	  and buttons to add pictures and upload.

2004-01-13  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b15)

	* Detect even more screwed up album hierarchies and
	  display an alert to suggest a fix.

2004-01-11  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b14)

	* Fixed adding album into root album: extra album would appear
	  in the GR tree.
	* Reverted to previous version of ImageMagick from Windows:
	  the version 1.2 shipped with caused many problems, because
	  it's harder to use in pseudo-installed mode.
	* Added support to move an album into another album, catching
	  up to protocol support that was added a while ago by Muti.
	* Slideshow is functional, added preference panel to set it up.
	  It still needs to be refined, but is complete enough for initial
	  feedback.

2003-12-29  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b13)

	* Reorganized the Mac build so that jpegtran.properties and
	  im.properties are readily editable in the application
	  bundle, similar to the Windows version.
	* Fixed Mac release URL in auto build system.
	* These changes forward-ported from 1.2.1-b6

2003-12-28  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b12)

	* MacOS Build now finds jpegtran even if application is renamed.
	* Deployment scripts now create Mac patch (same as the release version)
	  and version checker displays link to new Mac version on Mac.

2003-12-27  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b11)

	* Merged changes from 1.2.1, mostly MacOS changes.

2003-12-17  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b10)

	* Up and down arrow in the picture list once again selects the prev/next
	  picture, and makes sure it's visible.

2003-12-18  M. Scott Gartner <sgartner@pingbot.com> (1.3-b9)

    * Expanded Load/Save with Most Recently Used files remembered
    * We now load the last edited file (if the property to that effect is set)
      and this feature is on by default.
    * We now allow you to specify how many MRU files to show in the file menu
    * All of these new properties are on a new panel in the properties dialog
    * The title reflects whether the currently loaded file needs to be saved
      (by putting an asterisk '*' next to the file name).  We now update this
      asterisk more consistently.

2003-12-08  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b8)

	* Load/save improvements by Scott Gartner.
	* Made it possible to run GR (in much-degraded mode) with no libraries
	  and no icons, with java -jar GalleryRemote.jar
	* Fixed StackOverflow with corrupted Galleries that caused GR to hang while
	  logging in.
	* Initial support for client-side or applet slideshow.
	* Pruned .java files from JSX library, making it lighter and resolving a
	  conflict with recent versions of IntelliJ.

2003-12-03  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b7)

	* Merged changes from the recently released GR 1.2.

2003-11-20  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b6)

	* Refined the file saving UI, adding Save As and Close, as well as updating
	  the window title to reflect whether state has been updated and not saved
	  and save file name. These changes were created by Scott Gartner.

2003-11-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b5)

	* Changed GRI18n to make it a static class and simplified all the classes using
	  GRI18n.
	* Finalized Album tree and Album inspector (although changing album settings
	  is not implemented because protocol support is not yet ready).
	* Implemented drag and drop of pictures to the album tree.
	* Implemented preview of pictures already on server. This will also be used for
	  the slideshow mode.

2003-11-14  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b4)

	* Changed default URL for PHPNuke (removed the /nuke path, thanks ozgreg).
	* Implemented fetching images already on server. Right now, other than looking at
	  the thumbnails, you can't really do anything with them.
	* Many infrastructure changes to support this.

2003-11-13  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b3)

	* Fixed a problem with loading state. Saved states from pervious versions can
	  NOT be loaded, no error dialog is shown, a big exception is dumped to the log.
	* Fixed logging out of a Gallery.
	* Made albums with content bold in the JTree.
	* Inspectors are now scrollable for small trees.
	* Thanks to Scott Gartner for these suggestions (and others).

2003-11-13  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b2)

	* Implemented drag-and-drop on Albums. Moving pictures from one album to another
	  is finally very easy.
	* Finished hooking up the UI in the AlbumInspector. Downloading pictures
	  from the server and updating album settings is not yet implemented.
	* Set default button for each dialog, so hitting Enter is the same as
	  clicking OK.

2003-11-11  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.3-b1)

	* Albums are now displayed as a tree control
	* Album Inspector added (not yet fully functionnal)
	* this is a preliminary release

2003-12-17  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2.1-b4)

	* Now building jpegtran in Mac version, hard-coded ImageMagick
	  path to /usr/local/bin on Mac.
	* Fixed invoking external apps on Mac
	* Fixed loading default image when it's in a jar (for Mac).
	* Upgraded to JarBundler 0.3, which I extended to add support
	  for bundling executables.
	* Fixed BrowserLauncher to correctly detect Panther.
	* The Mac version is now fully functional!

2003-12-17  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2.1-b3)

	* Added alerts when ImageMagick or jpegtran are unavailable.
	* No longer showing rotate arrows when jpegtran is unavailable.

2003-12-16  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2.1-b2)

	* Fixed Mac version: Native Mac build now works, uses screen menu bar
	  (not window menu bar), uses Command instead of Control for
	  accelerators, uses brushed metal appearance.
	* Pruned .java files from JSX library, making it lighter and resolving a
	  conflict with recent versions of IntelliJ.

2003-12-09  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2.1-b1)

	* Some apps wouldn't let you drag and drop pictures to GR. This is now fixed
	  and DnD should work from Canon Zoombrowser, Photoshop Album and probably
	  also Linux file managers. No thanks to an article in JavaWorld that
	  had bad code for DnD. Thanks to Jeff "logullo" for testing many debug
	  builds for me.

2003-11-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2)

	* Release
	* Fixed the usual Java 1.3 bug.

2003-11-09  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b15)

	* Fixed jpegtran execution on platforms other than Win32 (bad command line)
	* Added more debug when executing external commands (now prints stdout and stderr
	  from external command to log).
	* For Mac build, added im.properties and jpegtran.properties to img.jar
	  so Mac app can be completely self-contained.
	* thanks to Amedeo Paglione for suggesting above fixes.

>>>>>>> 1.72.2.6
2003-11-06  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b14)

	* Almost complete rewrite of drag and drop code, fixing all the known bugs
	* Implemented cut-copy-paste for the list of pictures, so pictures can
	  now at long last be moved between albums (before upload)!
	* Fixed the QuickConfig preference not updating the other preference panels.
	  The fix is to close the preference dialog after QuickConfig is used, to
	  prevent conflicts.

2003-11-03  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b13)

	* Better memory management for thumbnails and previews. Memory errors
	  should be rarer, and thumbnail/preview generation should be quicker.
	* Added button to sort files alphabetically in an album.
	* GR should now find jpegtran and ImageMagick in that if they are
	  available in the PATH on non-Windows platforms. Added a long-winded
	  warning at the tail-end of the installer about how to install them.

2003-10-30  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b12)

	* Added warning when logging out or quitting and pictures are left in
	  a gallery, so no data is lost.
	* Updated bundled ImageMagick (windows only) to 5.5.7, added lib needed
	  for PNG images.
	* Fixed URL preferences getting lost.
	* Added disambiguation when 2 URLs for the same Gallery, but with different
	  usernames are present.
	* Fixed Quick Config losing the gallery type.

2003-10-09  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b11)

	* Implemented patching mechanism for LAX file when the classpath
	  needs to be changed.
	* Build process can now update Menalto.com with the latest build information
	  so automated daily builds are automatically propagated. Also now pushing
	  beta builds to jpmullan.com.
	* Cosmetic changes to the Log class.

2003-10-06  Amedeo Paglione <apaglione@mac.com> (1.2-b10)

	* Adoption of more generic locale
	* Optimized the procedure for locale loading

2003-10-02  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b9)

	* Better display for languages in the prefs dialog.
	* Changed from using a Java 1.4-only method to a standard method.
	  This was causing GR not to start under 1.3 VMs.

2003-09-30  Amedeo Paglione <apaglione@mac.com> (1.2-b8)

	* Implemented list of available locale resources.

2003-09-30  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b7)

	* Implemented UI in Preferences/General to select the locale
	  among the available locales.

2003-09-29  Amedeo Paglione <apaglione@mac.com> (1.2-b6)

	* Internationalized all strings in GR. English and Italian versions
	  available.

2003-09-27  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b5)

	* After images are removed from the list, another image is selected.
	  This has been a long-standing irritant...
	* Moving more than one picture up or down is now possible.
	* Suppressing auto-rotation on the server when the user manually
	  rotates the image or GR rotates it based on the EXIF data.

2003-09-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b4)

	* Implemented auto-rotate based on EXIF tag, if present. Now I need
	  protocol support to disable auto-rotate in the server when
	  uploading.
	* Implemented shutdown on upload completion. Thanks to Nick77.

2003-09-22  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b3)

	* Fixed PHPNuke default URLs (thanks docmattman).
	* When a read-only album is selected, drag-and-drop is not allowed
	  and the Add Pictures... button is disabled.
	* When creating a new album, select the album in the popup rather
	  than the first root album (only with G 1.4.1-b75 and later,
	  remote protocol 2.5).
	* Forcing file name on uploaded files to original filename, rather
	  than the temp file used when resizing and/or rotating (only with
	  G 1.4.1-b75 and later, remote protocol 2.5).

2003-09-21  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b2)

	* Implemented PHPNuke support (thanks docmattman).

2003-09-20  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.2-b1)

	* Integrated patch by Markus Cozowicz to provide feedback during long
	  uploads. Thanks Markus!
	* Created a new modal progress dialog for uploads. It shows much
	  more info, and is cancelable. The normal progress bar has been
	  improved to be less fickle when two things happen at the same
	  time.
	* Optionally ignore the return code of spawned applications. This is
	  to work around what I think is a Java VM bug on Linux where the
	  return code is wrong.
	* Amedeo Paglione started work on i18n. A simple framework is in place
	  and he's starting to externalize all UI strings.

2003-09-12  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1)

	* Shipped GR 1.1

2003-09-06  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-RC1-b1)

	* Fixed incompatibility with Java 1.3: I was trying to catch an exception
	  that Java 1.3 doesn't know about, so the class was not even loadable.
	* GR is now built for the Mac differently than for other architectures.
	  MacOS enjoys something akin to the "French Exception". Or in this case
	  the Italian exception, since this was led by Amedeo Paglione.

2003-08-22  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-RC1)

	* Catching error when using SSL with an untrusted server
	  certificate.

2003-07-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b14)

	* Added keyboard handling so when the user is editing captions
	  and extra fields, the tab and up/down arrows do the expected and
	  useful thing (thanks joel558).

2003-07-19  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b13)

	* Added a jpegQuality field to the ImageMagick settings.
	* Better handling of null username or password.
	* Clearing cookies when Log out is clicked, so it's possible
	  to log in with different credentials without having to restart GR.

2003-07-01  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b12)

	* Uses a shutdown handler on Mac for those folks who use Cmd-Q to quit.
	  Mac integration is sorely lacking. I need a Mac guy to help out.

2003-06-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b11)

	* Fixed losing field values when more than one extrafield is used
	  (thanks Joel)
	* Filtering out extrafields "Upload Date" and "Capture Date", which
	  are not editable (thanks Joel).
	* Temporarily building jpegtran in the zip patches until it's in the
	  installer.

2003-06-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b10)

	* Added ability for QuickConfig to handle gallery URLs (you need
	  to use url.99, or any other set of parameters as long as the
	  parameter ends in .99. This can be used to very easily add a
	  Gallery URL to GR, especially useful for CMS.
	* If username and/or password are not set, GalleryComm2 asks for
	  them. This is necessary for when passwords are not saved.
	* An empty Gallery object is no longer created when none have been
	  declared.

2003-06-26  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b9)

	* Implemented extra fields in UI and protocol.
	* New prefs panel: Quick Config, to help newbies set their
	  configuration to match the prefs of your gallery. This is me
	  pursuing my own agenda :-)

2003-06-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b8)

	* Implemented a new way to communicate with the server for getting
	  the list of albums, which is much more efficient because only
	  writable albums and their parents are sent, and because the server
	  does less work. This should fix one of the causes for socket exceptions
	  because listing the albums takes less time.
	* Since this new format is also hierarchical, this also paves the way for
	  an album tree component rather than a flat list (no implementation yet).
	* Fixed preview frame popping up before main frame.

2003-06-17  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b7)

	* Fixed rotation combined with flipping, fixed losing EXIF.
	* Picture added using the Browse button now appended to the
	  list instead of prepending them.

2003-06-16  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b6)

	* Implemented rotate-before-upload based on jpegtran.

2003-06-16  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b5)

	* Truncating long URLs in UI to make it nicer when CMS URLs are
	  used.
	* Added UI for rotating pictures before upload. Actual rotation
	  of pictures not implemented yet: only thumbnails.
	* Added icons on most buttons and menu items.

2003-06-13  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b4)

	* Reorganized event handling and data modeling for more
	  simplicity and robustness. Phewww...
	* Fixed creating top-level albums in some cases.
	* Fixed logging out.
	* Can now create a first album when no Album is available.
	* Removed the Username and password fields in MainFrame.
	* Preferences can be invoked in such a way that it jumps
	  to a panel immediately.
	* Fixed losing caption when selecting more than one picture.
	* Fixed drag-n-dropping folders.
	* Unhacked list selection.
	* Modified HTTPConnection so it can be instanciated on Java 1.3
	  even though https is not supported.

2003-06-12  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b3)

	* Preference property names are now constants in PreferenceNames rather
	  than just text litterals.
	* Added proxy support in the preferences.
	* Explicit HTTPS support (see the ReadMe).
	* Optionally strips the extension when using filename for caption.

2003-06-04  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.1-b2)

	* Added Upload, URLs, Proxy prefs panel.
	* Time in the logs is now in ms since application launch.
	* Sorted preferences files, for better readability.
	* Now pre-loading thumbnails and accurate file size when opening
	  saved state.
	* Reworked the Gallery class for more consistency and robustness.
	* Proxy panel is not yet functional.
	* Logging on to a PostNuke-embedded Gallery fails (I need help with this).

	* Added first embryo of a preferences dialog.

2003-06-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1)

	* No changes from RC1.
	* Non-Win32 builds get ImageMagick directory with instructions
	  on how to set it up.

2003-05-28  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-RC1)

	* No changes from b6.
	* No longer building 'run' batch scripts: running GR is now only
	  with the native InstallAnywhere launcher or ant.

2003-05-25  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b6)

	* When an auth error occurs, made the error message more informative.

2003-05-09  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b5)

	* No changes, just updated the automated build system to build the 1.0.x
	  branch rather than the new 1.1.x branch.

2003-05-06  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b4)

	* Improved stability of upload when IM is not installed.
	* Optionally HTML-escaping captions and titles during upload.
	* Display captions in the picture list.

	* Reformatted many source files using IdeaJ.

2003-02-02  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b3)

	  HTTP security. Thanks Stanley!
	* GR no longer checks the version before actual login.

2002-12-15  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b2)

	* Fixed selecting "Gallery main page" in the New Album dialog.

2002-12-14  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0.1-b1)

	* Corrected a small path problem in ImageUtils.
	* Bumped GalleryComm2 protocol version to 2.1.
	* Added client UI support for creating new albums.
	  The corresponding protocol support is not yet ready
	  so the button will remain disabled.
	* Added resizeToDefault property for resizing before upload with
	  protocol 1 and using default album size with protocol 2.

2002-10-19  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0-b10)

	* Fixed adding a Gallery (broken in b9).
	* Added undetermined progress bar to Fetch Albums.

2002-10-11 Tim Miller <tim_miller@users.sourceforge.net> (1.0-b9)

	* NOTE: GR CAN BE RUN IN GR PROTO 2 MODE BY CHANGING THE
	  protocolVersion IN THE PROPERTIES FILE.
	  THIS WILL ALL PAN OUT WITH THE NEXT CHECKIN -- GR WILL DYNAMICALLY
	  BIND TO THE NEWEST SERVER PROTOCOL. FOR NOW, CAVEAT EMPTOR.
	* Made GalleryComm and interface, moved GalleryComm implementation to
	  GalleryComm1.java.
	* Created GalleryComm2.java, based on GalleryComm1.java to implement
	  version 2 of the GR protocol.
	* Moved status interaction between GalleryComm classes and MainFrame

	  Album objects.
	* paour: Added support for resizing images based on server autoResize
	  size (only with protocol 2)

	* Added image resize before upload (this requires ImageMagick and can be enabled by
		changing the variables resizeTo and resizeBeforeUpload in
		GalleryRemote.properties.
	* Added automatic update notification for betas, too. Beta builds will come with
		this enabled. Release builds will only check for new releases, unless
		otherwise specified.

	* Added multi-album upload! Add pictures to different albums and click Upload
		Albums.
	* Almost complete rewrite of GalleryComm. Maybe it will be more robust, maybe
		more broken.
	* The preferences file is now called GalleryRemote.properties and resides in GalleryRemote
		in the home directory. This should fix problems with preferences not being saved
		but it means users will have to either copy the preferences file over themselves
		or recreate their preferences.
	* The file input dialog now accepts more types of media.
	* Fixed bug 612281: redirects needed two clicks.
	* Fixed bug 521237: non-unique album titles would confuse the Albums combo-box.

	* Fixed inspector state when deleting pictures
	* Now saving multiple profiles for different Galleries (use the URL combo box)

2002-09-01  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0-b2)

	* Now optionally using ImageMagick to load thumbnails and preview, for a 5x speedup
	  and better memory management. In the future, we'll use IM to also
	  offer client-side resize and rotate.

2002-08-18  Pierre-Luc Paour <gallery@paour.com> (1.0-b1)

	* Reorganized storage of list of files to upload in preparation for XML serialization

2001-11-20  Chris Smith <chris@jacko.com> (0.3-b2)

	* App now remembers the last used Gallery URL, username and password.

	* Bug fixes:
		- Trailing slash no longer required on Gallery URL.
		- Fixed race condtion where if login took too long the ui
		  thread would think that the upload was done and reset the
		  file list before the upload thread got a chance to upload.
		- Fetching Albums more than once will no longer append to the
		  existing list.

2001-11-14  Chris Smith <chris@jacko.com> (0.3-b1)
