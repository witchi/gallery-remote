#### 3. USING GALLERY REMOTE

You're on your own here, but it's pretty straightforward.


#### 4. CAN I RUN GALLERY REMOTE ON MY NON-WINDOWS OS?

Yes, maybe. Gallery Remote was written in Java. If you have Java 1.3 or later
installed on your machine, you may be able to run the app with the command:

```bash
   java -cp GalleryRemote.jar com.gallery.GalleryRemote.GalleryRemote
```	
assuming you are in the same directory as the GalleryRemote.jar file.

    
#### 5. KNOWN PROBLEMS

There are many, I am sure.


#### 6. HELP!!  WHERE DO I GO FOR HELP?

We're here to help you.  We want you to get Gallery up and running.
But please remember that Gallery is installed on many websites and
the Gallery authors get bombarded with lots of emails every day.
Be kind to us and try to use the resources we make available before
you fire off an email to us.

The first thing you should do is to read the Gallery Frequently
Asked Questions page, which is found [here](http://gallery.sourceforge.net/faq.php).

If you can't find your answer there, send your help requests to the
mailing lists. The Gallery users mailing list is [here](http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/gallery-users).


We respond to each and every request for help.  There are very few
problems that we have not been able to work through.  We *will* get
you up and running.  But, remember that every email we respond to robs
us of time that we could be spending improving the quality of Gallery
and adding new features.

Speaking of quality and features, if you find a bug you can file
it in our [Bug Tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=7130&atid=107130). File new bugs in the GitHub issue list. If you think of a new feature, you can file it in our [Feature
Tracker](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=357130&group_id=7130&func=browse).

It's a good idea to check through these databases to see if the
bug/feature that you're referring to is already in there.

The documentation is available on (http://codex.gallery2.org/index.php/Gallery_Remote:FAQ)


#### 7. THE GALLERY PROTOCOL

The application communicates with a Gallery server using a defined protocol.
You can find the protocol documentation [here](http://codex.gallery2.org/index.php/Gallery_Remote:Protocol).

THE END.
