    <_description>
Display a slideshow based on a Gallery web site.

Specify the URL to your Gallery as:

 http://www.example.com/gallery

You don't have to enter a username and password if you only want to show publicly available pictures.

If the album is on a Gallery 2 server, provide as the name of the album the album ID. You can provide
one album, a comma-separated list of albums, or no album at all (in which case the entire Gallery will
be used).
